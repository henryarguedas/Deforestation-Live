                    <h2>The Problem Facing the World's Forests</h2>
                    <p>Deforestation is the removal of forests from land which is then converted to non-forest use.  Deforestation involves conversion of forest land to farms, ranches, or urban use.  We need healthy forests to live.</p>

                    <h2>Main Factors Driving Deforestation Around the Globe</h2>
                    <p>With the current rate of deforestation, we can expect the end of the world to come by 2029, July 1st to be exact.  The mechanism by which this will happen is already upon us: first, you cut or burn the trees down, then you plant millions of miles of soybeans to feed cattle and make soy milk for vegans and coffee drinkers, then, when those crops are in need of nutrients, you pour, spray, and dump commercial fertilizers and chemicals like insecticides all over the land and this will eventually run off into the rivers and lakes, spoiling the land all around and finding its way into the human blood stream.</p><br>

                    <h2>How Does the Loss of Forests Affect the World?</h2>
                    <p>But, it won’t matter that humans are consuming mass amounts of chemicals because the forests are already gone by then, and that means that there is no air to breath because of the carbon sink!  Once that happens, The Apocalypse is not far off, and there will be two factions who will survive, meagerly and savagely, and they will rule the spoiled earth.</p>

                    <h2>Fires in the Amazon</h2>
                    <p>For recent examples of deforestation, we need to look to further than the Amazon rainforest, especially in Brazil.  Farmers and ranchers clear cut or set fire to huge swaths of centuries old tropical rainforest to make room for cattle and crops, such as soybeans.  The Amazon is currently burning at a rate of one football field per minute, and with no one fighting the fires, the situation has become a global catastrophe, igniting bitter feuds between world leaders such as France’s Macron and Brazil’s Bolsonaro.  Macron has proposed stopping trade deals worth billions to Brazil because of Bolsonaro’s refusal to take the lead on operations that would stop the fires in the Amazon.

                    <h2>World Leaders Spar over Amazon Fires</h2>
                    <p>At the 2019 G7 meeting, world leaders offered US $20 million dollars to Brazil to aid in fighting the fires in that country, but Bolsonaro wants more, and knowing that he has leverage, along with the world’s attention, has waffled on any decision to accept foreign aid.  For Bolsonaro, and many Brazilians, the issue is a question of sovereignty, and in jabs at Macron and other European leaders he has referenced historical transgressions such as the colonization of his country and held the foreign powers up to account for what he considers to be a supreme hypocrisy of developed countries.  With remarks that essentially tell his foreign critics to look to their own forests if they are so concerned with deforestation, Bolsonaro fans the flames</p>
